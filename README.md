# Synapse App

Banking application, which allows users to create an account, make (fake) transactions, and view those transactions in a stacked bar chart as well as in a table.

## Running the Application

Create a SynapseFI account - follow directions [here](https://docs.synapsefi.com/docs/getting-started).
Create a .env file with CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, and FINGERPRINT.

```
CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
FINGERPRINT=YOUR_FINGERPRINT
```

Install dependencies in the server and the React client.
Run with 'yarn dev' in terminal, which will open the app in your browser.
